## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS animations/transitions with @keyframes
- SCSS variables

### What I learned

I've used max-content and min-content for sizing of objects in my project. I've never used them before and they can come in handy while dealing with sizing text and images. Using those properties is also responsive, so I don't need to care about my layout being different on mobile screens.

### Useful resources

- [Imagecolorpicker](https://imagecolorpicker.com/) - I could get colors from the design straight into my project
